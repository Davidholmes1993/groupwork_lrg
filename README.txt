For the gene you want to investigate on https://www.lrg-sequence.org/ ,
download the .xml file for that gene and save this into the same folder from
the repository from Github.

On your command line, type python exon_coordinates_finder.py
as well as the name of the LRG file that you have downloaded and saved
with a space in between the program and filename.
For example if you downloaded LRG_1,
type into the command line:
python exon_coordinates_finder.py LRG_1.xml

You will receive a message for the name of the file where your results
are stored in a .bed file, which will be found in the repository folder.
Open this file to see the information about the gene name, LRG number,
the exons and the coordinates where the exons start and end
in the LRG file.
